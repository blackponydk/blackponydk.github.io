## Racial Ability Scores
Each race, other than Human, will use three +1's instead of their natural ability score bonuses that can be placed into any ability score. Any racial negative scores such as Orc's minus to Intelligence is ignored/removed from the race. They can be spread out to three different ability scores, or stacked to a maximum of +2 in one ability score and +1 in another ability score. This is to exemplify that not every Gnome is intelligent just as not every Dragonborn is strong. Any race can be just as good as the next race at something they want to excel at.
