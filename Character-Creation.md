## Ability Scores
All characters can use either the standard array(15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) or 39 point buy. Ability scores are assigned as you want.

#### Ability Score Point Cost

| Score | Cost | Score | Cost |
|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|
|  6    | 0    |  12   | 6    |
|  7    | 1    |  13   | 7    |
|  8    | 2    |  14   | 9    |

|  10   | 4    |  16   | 14   |
|  11   | 5    |

## Hit Points
Hit points for 1st level are your hit die maximum. When you gain a level, roll the die to determine your hit points for the level. After the result, you can choose to use the average instead.

## Experience Points and Character Level
I use the Milestone system. All player characters in the party will be the same level.

## Inspiration

Each player will start the session with one point of Inspiration. This point may be used to perform an **Insipired Action**.

### Inspired Action

When you take an Inspired Action, you can either gain advantage on an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw OR you can give advantage to someone else’s ability check, attack roll, or saving throw provided you are in a position to assist them directly in some way OR impose disadvantage on someone else’s ability check, attack roll, or saving throw provided you are in a position to hinder their action directly in some way.

Whatever it is, the Inspired Action MUST somehow connect to one of your Personal Characteristics.

##### Examples
Briegnar has the characteristic: *I will take any risk to save a person in danger.*

He sees that a traveling compainion is about to fall of the ledge. He could use his Inspiration to "heroicly jump forward and try to catch the falling person," giving that person advantage on the save to not fall off. 

To avoid a collapsing ceiling, he could throw yourself at a person to save them, suffering the effects instead.

If a monster is about to attack someone standing near him, he can use his reaction to interpose himself and give the monster disadvantage on the attack roll.

### Setback

If you do not have Inspiration, you can claim a Setback to gain Inspiration. To claim a Setback you must either impose disadvantage on one of your own ability checks, saving throws, or attack rolls based on one of your Personal Characteristics OR make a decision that creates a significant story setback, obstacle, or hindrance. When you want to claim a Setback, ask the DM.

After you claim a Setback, you get Inspiration.

##### Examples

“I’m easily distracted by shiny objects, so I’m distracted by the giant pile of treasure. Can I Claim a Setback and take disadvantage on my saving throw against the dragon’s fire breath?”

“This guy wants to help us, but I distrust all strangers. I’m going to be rude and accusatory of him. Can I Claim a Setback for that?” And then the DM might have the stranger refuse to help or get offended or start a fight.

## Spell Points
I allow spell points to be used in-place of spell slots.
